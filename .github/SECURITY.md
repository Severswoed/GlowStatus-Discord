# GitHub Actions Security & Cost Control

## 🛡️ Security Measures Implemented

### **Access Control**
- **Owner/Maintainer Only**: Actions can only be triggered by repository owners or explicitly listed maintainers
- **No External Contributors**: Prevents unauthorized users from consuming resources or accessing builds
- **Specific User Allowlist**: Currently limited to `["Severswoed"]` - update as needed
- **Secure Credential Handling**: OAuth secrets are injected at build time, never stored in repository

### **Financial Protection**
- **Secure Credential Storage**: Google OAuth and Chocolatey API keys stored in GitHub Secrets (encrypted)
- **Environment Approval Gates**: Publishing requires manual approval via GitHub Environments
- **Artifact Retention Limits**: 
  - Windows builds: 30 days (reduces storage costs)
  - Chocolatey packages: 90 days (for publishing workflow)
- **Authenticated Publishing**: All operations use encrypted secrets securely
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Sensitive files are removed after build completion

### **Cost Breakdown**
```
✅ FREE Operations:
- Building Windows executable
- Creating Chocolatey packages  
- Uploading GitHub artifacts
- Creating GitHub releases

� AUTOMATED (Secure):
- Chocolatey publishing (uses your API key securely)
- Package submission to community review queue

�💰 POTENTIAL COSTS (All Controlled):
- GitHub Actions minutes (only for authorized users)
- GitHub artifact storage (auto-expires)
- Chocolatey API usage (minimal, covered by free tier)
```

## 🔒 What Other Users CANNOT Do

### **Repository Contributors/Collaborators**
- ❌ Cannot trigger manual builds
- ❌ Cannot access workflow artifacts  
- ❌ Cannot publish packages
- ✅ Can view workflow results (read-only)

### **External Users**
- ❌ Cannot trigger any workflows
- ❌ Cannot access private artifacts
- ❌ Cannot incur any costs on your account
- ✅ Can see public releases after publishing

### **Fork Security**
- ❌ Forked repositories cannot use your GitHub Actions minutes
- ❌ Forked workflows run on the fork owner's account
- ✅ Original repository remains isolated

## 🎛️ Additional Security Controls

### **Repository Settings** (Recommended)
1. **Branch Protection**:
   ```
   Settings → Branches → Add rule for 'main'
   ✅ Require pull request reviews
   ✅ Restrict pushes to specific users
   ```

2. **Actions Permissions**:
   ```
   Settings → Actions → General
   ✅ Allow only specific actions
   ✅ Require approval for first-time contributors
   ```

3. **Environment Protection**:
   ```
   Settings → Environments → chocolatey-publish
   ✅ Required reviewers: [your username]
   ✅ Wait timer: 0 minutes
   ```

### **Workflow Permissions**
The workflow only requests:
- `contents: read` - Read repository files
- `actions: read` - Read workflow artifacts  
- `packages: write` - Create GitHub releases

**NOT requested:**
- No external API access
- No payment processing permissions
- No third-party service integrations

## 🚨 Monitoring & Alerts

### **GitHub Actions Usage**
Monitor your usage at: `Settings → Billing → Plans and usage`
- **Free tier**: 2,000 minutes/month
- **Typical build**: ~10-15 minutes
- **Security**: Only authorized users can consume minutes

### **Cost Alerts** (Recommended)
1. Set up billing alerts in GitHub Settings
2. Monitor artifact storage usage
3. Review workflow run history monthly

### **Audit Trail**
All workflow runs are logged with:
- User who triggered the build
- Timestamp and duration
- Resource consumption
- Artifact creation/deletion

## 🔧 Emergency Controls

### **Immediate Actions** (If Compromised)
1. **Disable Workflows**:
   ```
   Settings → Actions → General → Disable actions
   ```

2. **Revoke Access**:
   ```
   Settings → Manage access → Remove collaborators
   ```

3. **Delete Artifacts**:
   ```
   Actions tab → Select workflow → Delete artifacts
   ```

### **Workflow Modifications**
To make workflows even more restrictive:

```yaml
# Add to workflow file
if: github.actor == 'Severswoed' && github.repository_owner == 'Severswoed'
```

## 📝 Best Practices

### **Regular Maintenance**
- [ ] Review collaborator access monthly
- [ ] Monitor GitHub Actions usage
- [ ] Clean up old artifacts manually if needed
- [ ] Update allowed user list as team changes

### **Safe Workflow Development**
- [ ] Test workflows on forks first
- [ ] Use environment secrets for sensitive data
- [ ] Implement approval gates for publishing
- [ ] Document all external service integrations

## ✅ Security Verification Checklist

- [x] Only authorized users can trigger builds
- [x] No automatic publishing to external services
- [x] No API keys or credentials in workflow
- [x] Artifact retention limits configured
- [x] Manual approval required for publishing
- [x] Cost-limiting measures in place
- [x] Audit trail available for all actions

**Result**: The workflow is secure and cost-controlled. Other users cannot spend your money or access sensitive operations.
